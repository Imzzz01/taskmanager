   - Proper foreign key relationships with cascading rules
2. Form Handling
   - Dynamic category filtering based on logged-in user
   - Date input widgets for better UX
   - ModelForms for efficient data handling
3. View logic
   - Class based views where appropriate
   - Login-required decorator for security
   - Efficient query filtering
   - AJAX support for category creation
4. Template Structure
   - Base template for consistent layout
   - Modular components(e.g., category modal)
   - Conditional displays based on task states
5. JavaScript Enhancements

# Internal and External Code <a id="internal-and-external-code"></a>

Backend:

I have built the core fuctionality using Django's powerful framework. 

1. Data organisation(Models)
   - Our category model lets users create personalised groups like ("study", "work", "shopping" etc) 
   - The task model handles all tasks details and smart features:
      - A three-tier priority system(High/Medium/Low) that drives visual cues.
      - Optional due dates with automatic overdue detection
      - Flexible categorisation that persists even if categories change.

2. Logic and processing (views)
   - Specialised views handle every user action:
      - A smart task listers that filters by priority or category
      - A secure creation/editing workflows with form validation
      - An efficient completion toggle that updates instantly via AJAX

3. User Interface (Templates)
   - Dynamic pages that adapt to your data:
      - Automatic priority coloring (red for urgent tasks)
      - Clean card-based layouts with hover actions
      - Interactive modals or adding categories without page reloads
    
Frontend: The Interactive Experience
- Javascript:
   - Instant task completion toggles
   - Smooth category creation popups

- Custom styling:
   - Clear visual hierarchy( priority colors, due date prominence)
   - Mobile-friendly designs that work on any device
   - Pleasant animations for completed tasks

Essential Frameworks:
- Django provides the secure foundation for user accounts and data handling
- Bootstrap 5 ensures professional, consistent interfaces
